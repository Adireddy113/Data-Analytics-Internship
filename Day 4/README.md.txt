 ### SQL for Data Analysis

I worked on a simple dataset based on books and their orders, and used MySQL for writing and running the queries.


 I created a `books` table which included details like book title, author, genre, price, published year, and available stock. Then I added some sample data for testing. 


Using these tables, I wrote several queries covering the most important concepts in SQL. I used SELECT statements to view all records and applied WHERE clauses to filter based on conditions like price or stock. I used ORDER BY to sort the data in different ways


I then practiced GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM and AVG to analyze the data further . To explore relationships between tables, I used JOINs to combine data from the `books` and `orders` tables 


I also tried writing subqueries 


After that, I created a view that shows the total stock available per genre, which can be reused anytime without writing the same query again. Finally, I created an index on the price column to improve performance while filtering or sorting based on price.


Overall, this task helped me improve my SQL skills by giving hands-on experience with different types of queries. It also gave me a better understanding of how real-world databases are structured and how to extract insights using SQL.
