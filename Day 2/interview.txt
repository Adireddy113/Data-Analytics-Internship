1. What is the importance of data visualization?

      Data visualization helps convert raw data into understandable and actionable insights. It makes patterns and                  outliers easier to detect and supports better decision-making.

2. When do you use a pie chart vs a bar chart?

    Pie charts are used for showing parts of a whole (e.g., market share), but only when you have 4–5 categories. Bar charts are used for comparing values across categories.

3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?

    Use storytelling, highlight important points with annotations, apply consistent and appealing color schemes, and allow interactivity in dashboards (filters, drilldowns).

4. What is data storytelling?

    Data storytelling is the practice of combining data, visuals, and narrative to communicate insights in a meaningful way that resonates with your audience.

5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?

   Always start the Y-axis at zero

    Avoid cherry-picking data or excluding context

6. What are best practices in dashboard design?

   Use KPIs at the top (e.g., Total Sales, Profit Margin)

   Use consistent layout and colors
  

7. What tools have you used for visualization?

    I’ve worked with Power BI , Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for custom plots, and Excel for quick reports.
